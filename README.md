## Usage

1. Open executable or run script, you know the gig.
1. Get `url` of steam profile for desired player (like on GIF).
1. Tap <kbd>CAPS LOCK</kbd> and if he/she played Castle Fight you'll see his MMR. 
>When you have something different inside clipboard or player haven't played CF ever or after MMR update **shortcut might stop working**. But hey, I made you nice button, so don't be sad. :)
4. App is floating on top, but sometimes not over Dota 2 (fullscreen mode), **BUT** it should detect url in clipboard and shortcut should work even though app is not directly in focus.
